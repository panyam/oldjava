<P>This document will guide you through the steps used to install and
configure the Service Validator Tool (SVT).  The tool has been developed in
order to assist in data validation and data cleansing for the CSOM
database.  In this section you will also find information
in  laymans terms about the required components and how they piece
together.  In order to help with the extension of this software,
information regarding SVT's design has also been included.  This section
highlights the design methodology, flow and relationships between objects
and the various design strategies used.
<P>There are, at the minimum, four software packages you'll need in order to
get up and running.  These are as follows:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>The Java Runtime Environment or the Java Development Kit (for extension
and source code hacking).;</LI>
<LI>The XML API for Java;</LI>
<LI>The Oracle JDBC drivers;</LI>
<LI>The actual software itself;</LI>
</UL>

</H2>
<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-Warning"></A> <A NAME="ss2.1">2.1 Warning</A>
</H2>
These instructions are only basic guide and no responsibility is taken for
any side effects that may be caused.

<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-Requirements"></A>
    <A NAME="ss2.2">2.2 Minimum Requirements</A>
</H2>
The minimum requirements are:
<ul>
<li>Java Runtime Environment or Java Development Kit: 1.4 or Higher</li>
<li>Xerces XML4J API: 1.4 or Higher</li>
<li>Oracle Client: 8.1.7 or Higher</li>
<li>Oracle JDBC Libraries: 1.2 or Higher</li>
</ul>

<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-JREInstall"></A>
    <A NAME="ss2.3">2.3 Install the JRE</A>
</H2>
<p>
Firstly, a recent (1.4+) Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required in the
host machine.  If a valid JRE is not installed, please download and install
one from <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/download.html>here</a>.  
<p>
If you wish to play around with the source code or compile it yourself, you
will require the Java Development Kit (JDK) rather than the JRE.  The JDK
includes a JRE and can be downloaded from the above mentioned site.
<p>
Once installed, please note the directory in which the JRE (or the JDK) has been installed.

<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-XMLInstall"></A>
    <A NAME="ss2.4">2.4 Install the XML API</A>
</H2>
<p>
The XML libraries are one of the core libraries for the Service Validator
Tool.  These libraries are used for all storage of data in both disk and in
memory.  These can be downloaded from <a
href=http://xml.apache.org/dist/xerces-j/>Apache XML4J Distribution
Site</a>.  This site contains the latest versions.  Note that for all
purposes (of the SVT use), only the binaries will suffice.  Download the
binaries in the format you would find easiest to extract.  Once you
downloaded, extract it into any directory.  <strong> Note: </strong>After
extraction of the files, verify that the <strong>xerces.jar</strong> has
been extracted.  Normally this file would be found in the
XML_EXTRACTION_DIRECTORY itself.  If not, move the file xerces.jar to the
extraction directory.

<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-ORAInstall"></A>
    <A NAME="ss2.5">2.5 Install Oracle JDBC Client</A>
</H2>
Install the Oracle client (8.1.7 or higher) by following the Oracle
installations.  Also ensure that the file "classes12.zip" is installed in
the ORACLE_INSTALLATION_DIRECTORY\jdbc\lib\ directory.

<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-SWConfig"></A>
    <A NAME="ss2.6">2.6 Configuring the Software</A>
</H2>
Once the above three core APIs and/or drivers have been installed, two
scripts need to be edited to point to the directories where the above
software are installed. These are as follows:

<p>
<li>
<strong>Configuring Run Scripts:</strong>
</li>
<p>
The run script, "run.bat", is located in the SVT installation directory
(for example, c:\svtool or c:\program files\svtool).  Edit this file, and
the contents are similar to the following:
<pre>
@echo off
...
...
set JDK_LOC=c:\dev\j2eedk\jdk
set XML_LOC=c:\dev\xerces-1_4_4
set ORA_LOC=c:\orant
...
...
</pre>
Now in the above three lines, substitute the locations of JDK_LOC, XML_LOC
and ORA_LOC variables to <strong>YOUR</strong> installation directories of
the JDK (or JRE), XML and Oracle software, respectively.

<p>
<li>
<strong>Configuring Make Scripts:</strong>
</li>
<p>
If you are interested in compiling the source code then you MUST
have the JDK installed.  Edit the make script, "make.bat", also located in
the SVT Installation directory.  Like the run script, make.bat will also
have the following lines:
<pre>
@echo off
...
...
set JDK_LOC=c:\dev\j2eedk\jdk
set XML_LOC=c:\dev\xerces-1_4_4
set ORA_LOC=c:\orant
...
...
</pre>
Once again substitute the locations of JDK_LOC, XML_LOC and ORA_LOC
variables to <strong>YOUR</strong> installation directories of the JDK, XML
and Oracle software, respectively.

<H2>
    <A NAME="Installation-Cleanup"></A>
    <A NAME="ss2.7">2.7 Cleanup/Uninstall</A>
</H2>

<p>
The SVT and the XML software can be removed by deleting the entire
directories.

<p>
In order to remove the JDK and Oracle software please consult the
appropriate application user manuals.
