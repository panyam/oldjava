	<font size="+1"><b>Introduction</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="a1"><li><a href="#qa1"><b>What is the purpose of Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		Back in the early 1990's, it was difficult to find useful collections of Windows
		icons. There were many icons available, but they were usually random collections
		of unrelated images. They were often stored in <b>DLL</b> files making it difficult to
		find an icon to suit a particular need. Other collections consisted of many hundreds
		of individual icon files which were easy to display in Windows folders, but these
		collections used up a huge amount of disk space because of the cluster size of disks.
		These early collections of icons also contained many duplicates.
		Icon Library was created to overcome these problems by: 
		<ul>
			<li>Bringing together a wide variety of icons into a single collection.
			<li>Removing thousands of duplicate icons to create a unique collection.
			<li>Sorting all the icons into categories so they are easier to find.
			<li>Storing all the individual icons into "libraries" to save disk space
			and speed up disk access.
			<li>Making the background transparent if it improves the look of the icon.
			<li>Cleaning up messy images within icons.
			<li>Creating new icons to complete icon sets; eg. same image in several colors.
			<li>Providing a viewer program to look at the icons and extract individual ones.
		</ul>
		Icon Library is <b>not</b> an icon editing program. It is not able to edit icons or to
		change the contents of <b>ICL</b> icon library files. There are other well written
		programs such as <a href="http://impactsoft.com" target="ma">MicroAngelo</a> which
		perform these functions. Iocn Library does not try to compete with these top quality
		products.
	<p><a name="a2"><li><a href="#qa2"><b>What is new in this version of Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		<b>Version 5</b>
		<ul>
			<li>Added many additional icons. More than 20,000 icons are now available in
			the full, registered version of Icon Library. This is double of what was available
			in the previous version.
			<li>Reorganised categories, with many new ones added.
			<li>Added the ability to handle 256 color icons.
			<li>Added the ability to handle multiple sizes of icons.
			<li>Added the ability to handle icons containing multiple images.
			<li>Provided an installation option which enables a feature where double clicking
			on <b>ICL</b> files will open Icon Library showing the contents of that <b>ICL</b>
			file.
			<li>Removed animated icons and the animation option to prevent user confusion. The
			animated icons were ot really of much use and many people often asked me how they
			could be used on the desktop. I do not know of any practical way to have animated
			icons, as opposed to animated cursors, on the desktop so it is best for me to not
			have this option available.
			<li>Documentation and help files are now written in HTML format for easy access both
			online and offline. The documentation is much more detailed than in previous versions.
			<li>Some technical papers have been included describing several Icon Library
			applications.
			<li>This FAQ was written and included with the new documentation.
			<li>Various minor bugs were fixed.
			<li>I have temporarily prevented the ability for the program to save icons from
			<b>EXE</b> and <b>DLL</b> files because of their varying formats. Trying to save icons
			from these files often caused Icon Library to crash. I know that it can be done, so
			a future version of Icon Library will re-instate the ability to save icons from these
			files. In the meantime, I wanted to get this version out as soon as possible!
		</ul>
	<p><a name="a3"><li><a href="#qa3"><b>Where can I get the shareware version?</b></a><br>
		The shareware version of Icon Library can always be downloaded from
		<a href="http://iconlibrary.com">http://iconlibrary.com</a>. There are also many other
		software archives that distribute Icon Library, but they may not always have the latest
		version.
	<p><a name="a4"><li><a href="#qa4"><b>Where can I get the registered version?</b></a><br>
		The registered version of Icon Library can only be obtained by paying a
		registration fee. You can register by going to
		<a href="http://iconlibrary.com">http://iconlibrary.com</a>
		and clicking on either the <b>Digibuy</b> or <b>PayPal</b> links. You will be required
		to pay a US$29 registration fee if you are purchasing a single license. When I have
		been notified by <b>Digibuy</b> or <b>PayPal</b> that you have registered, I will
		email you instructions on how to download the full, registered version of Icon Library.
	<p><a name="a5"><li><a href="#qa5"><b>How can I contact you, the author?</b></a><br>
		You can contact me either by email or the post. My email address is
		<a href="mailto:steve@iconlibrary.com">steve@iconlibrary.com</a> and my postal
		address is
		<pre>
	Steve Balogh
	PO Box 414
	Caulfield East
	Melbourne, Victoria
	Australia. 3145</pre>
		I do not use any instant messaging service such as IRC or ICQ.
	<p><a name="a6"><li><a href="#qa6"><b>Do you provide telephone support?</b></a><br>
		I do not provide telephone support. Since most of the Icon Library users seem to live
		in the USA and I live in Australia it is not very practical to provide telephone
		support.
	<p><a name="a7"><li><a href="#qa7"><b>Do you listen to suggestions regarding Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		Yes. I am always open to suggestions on how Icon Library can be improved. The best
		way to pass on your suggestions is by sending email to
		<a href="mailto:steve@iconlibrary.com">steve@iconlibrary.com</a>
	<p><a name="a8"><li><a href="#qa8"><b>Is the shareware version of Icon Library time limited?</b></a><br>
		No, there are no time limits on the shareware version of Icon Library. It will
		continue working indefinately.
	<p><a name="a9"><li><a href="#qa9"><b>How is the shareware version of Icon Library limited?</b></a><br>
		There are a lot fewer icons available in the shareware version of Icon Library. The
		full version has more than 20,000 icons but the shareware version only has approximately
		3,000 icons. The shareware version of the Icon Library viewer program displays a popup
		window when it is started to remind the user to register. The full version does not.
	<p><a name="a10"><li><a href="#qa10"><b>Do you provide additional previews of the full Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		The <a href="http://iconlibrary.com">Icon Library website</a> contains a list of all
		icon categories and the number of icons contained in each one. There are also slightly
		blurred screenshots of all the icons contained in the full version of Icon Library.
	<p><a name="a11"><li><a href="#qa11"><b>Why don't you include more 256 color icons in Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		Icon Library was originally created when only 32x32 16 color icons were in common use
		and I concentrated on collecting that particular format. The viewer program could
		always display 256 color icons, however, there were problems when trying to extract them
		as individual icons. Starting with version 5 this is no longer a problem and all formats
		of icons can now be successfully extracted. There are more than 20,000 icons in Icon
		Library so I expect that there are not too many 16 color icons remaining that are
		not already in the collection. The only path forward is to look at 256 color 
		and larger format icons so I will be expanding in that direction. I am always on the
		lookout for suitable icons, including 256 color and larger format ones. All
		contributions are welcome of course!

	<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Installation</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="b1"><li><a href="#qb1"><b>How do I install Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		An installation guide is available <a href="installation_1.html">here</a>
	<p><a name="b2"><li><a href="#qb2"><b>How do I remove Icon Library from my computer?</b></a><br>
		Instructions on how to remove Icon Library from your system are available
		<a href="installation_4.html#uninstall">here</a>.
	<p><a name="b3"><li><a href="#qb3"><b>What versions of Windows does Icon Library support?</b></a><br>
		Icon Library has been tested and is known to work with all versions of Windows
		including Win3.1, Win95, Win98, WinME, WinNT, Win2K and WinXP.
	<p><a name="b4"><li><a href="#qb4"><b>Can Icon Library use the new Windows XP icons?</b></a><br>
		The new format WinXP icons will not work with Icon Library.
	<p><a name="b5"><li><a href="#qb5"><b>I have installed Icon Library but cannot find any icons. Why?</b></a><br>
		This used to be a problem with previous versions of Icon Library. When the files were
		extracted from the distributed <b>ZIP</b> archive it was possible to switch off the
		option which reconstructed the required folder structure. If the Icon Library files
		were not in the expected folders, the viewer program could not find them and it
		appeared as if there were no icons available. The new self-extracting archive will
		automatically recreate the correct folder structure so this problem should no longer
		appear. If it does happen to you, please let me know by
		<a href="mailto:steve@iconlibrary.com">email</a>.
	<p><a name="b6"><li><a href="#qb6"><b>Why am I asked which program to use when clicking on ICL files?</b></a><br>
		Windows does not yet know what program handles Icon Library files with the
		<b>ICL</b> extension. If you double click on a file extension that Windows does not
		recognise, you will see a window appear asking you to specify which program will
		open that file type in future. Enable the option labelled <b>Always use this...</b>
		and then click on the <b>Other...</b> button. Browse to the Icon Library viewer
		program, eg <b>icolib5_shar.exe</b>, and select it by double clicking on the program
		name. Click on the <b>OK</b> button and you should no longer be asked which program
		to use. There is another method which overcomes this problem described
		<a href="installation_3.html#registry">here</a>.
	<p><a name="b7"><li><a href="#qb7"><b>I get an error asking for the location of Icon.exe. Why?</b></a><br>
		Windows has already associated <b>ICL</b> files with a program called <b>icon.exe</b>
		but this program either does not exist or has been moved on your system. You may be
		able to solve this problem by following these
		<a href="installation_3.html#registry">instructions</a>.
	<p><a name="b8"><li><a href="#qb8"><b>The first icon in each category was replaced by a single icon. Why?</b></a><br>
		I suspect you may have changed the icon association for the ICL extension in Windows Explorer.
		Open your Registry Editor <b>regedit</b> and look for <b>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT/iclfile/DefaultIcon</b>.
		You should see a <b>(Default)</b> StringValue entry containing <b>%1</b>. Chances are that it will be
		pointing to some other pathname containing the currently displayed icon. Change the <b>(Default)</b>
		entry back to <b>%1</b>. Windows Explorer does not always respond to this change to your registry
		because it caches the icons it displays. You may have to restart your PC to display the
		original icons.

	<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Using Icon Library</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="c1"><li><a href="#qc1"><b>How do I start using Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		A <a href="manual_1.html">User Manual</a> has been provided which gives you
		detailed instructions on how to use Icon Library.
	<p><a name="c2"><li><a href="#qc2"><b>Where are all the icons in the shareware version?</b></a><br>
		The shareware version of Icon Library only comes with a small number of all the
		icons available in the full, registered version. Some of the categories will contain
		all the available icons, while many of the other categories will not contain any icons.
		The categories without icons will instead display a reminder to register the program.
		The menu names which contain icons will have <b>(SHAREWARE)</b> appended to the
		menu name. The <a href="http://iconlibrary.com">Icon Library web site</a> will
		contain screenshots of all the icons available in the full version of the program
		so you can see what you will receive when you register.
	<p><a name="c3"><li><a href="#qc3"><b>Why does the shareware version have two ICOLIB.INI files?</b></a><br>
		The <b>Registered Menu</b> will load all of the categories, including the ones
		that are only available in the registered version of Icon Library. The
		<b>Shareware Menu</b> loads only those categories which contain icons. This menu is
		provided for your convenience so you don't have to search for categories containing
		icons. The registered version of Icon Library only provides the full menu.
	<p><a name="c4"><li><a href="#qc4"><b>Why would I want to change the display background color?</b></a><br>
		Try it! Display a collection of icons using a white background and then change the
		background to a another color. The icons will appear to be quite different especially
		if you change from a light background to a dark one. This option allows you to see
		what the icons look like against different backgrounds.
	<p><a name="c5"><li><a href="#qc5"><b>What is the purpose of the BMP transparent color option?</b></a><br>
		Icons can have pixels designated as being transparent but bitmaps do not have that
		ability. This option allows you to choose a color that represents these transparent
		pixels. When you save the bitmap file, you will see the transparent parts of the
		image set to this color. When you edit this image you can manipulate these pixels
		as desired. For example, in Photoshop you can set this color to be transparent again
		before saving the image as a GIF file, since GIF files can handle transparent pixels.
	<p><a name="c6"><li><a href="#qc6"><b>How do I find an icon I need?</b></a><br>
		The best way is to look through the Icon Library categories. They have been sorted
		in a reasonably logical manner, making it fairly easy to find icons on for a
		specific purpose. There are no search tools available with Icon Library. Searching
		for images is an almost impossible task, while creating search keywords for each
		of the 20,000 icons would be an enormous, tedious task.
	<p><a name="c7"><li><a href="#qc7"><b>Can I extract a single icon from the library?</b></a><br>
		Yes you can. Here are the <a href="manual_3.html#saveicons">instructions</a> that
		tell you how. You can extract an icon and save it as either an <b>ICO</b> icon file
		or a <b>BMP</b> bitmap file.
	<p><a name="c8"><li><a href="#qc8"><b>Can Windows access icons in the ICL icon library files?</b></a><br>
		Yes. If you don't want to extract any icons but prefer to keep them in their
		original <b>ICL</b> files, you can still point Windows to these icons. Most places
		where you would use an <b>ICO</b> type icon, you can also use one contained in an
		<b>ICL</b> file. The main difference is that you will have many icons to chose from
		rather than the single icon normally found in an <b>ICO</b> file. When trying to
		open an <b>ICL</b> file, you may need to select the <b>All Types</b> option within
		the <b>Open</b> window otherwise the <b>ICL</b> files may not be displayed. You
		should also be careful not to move or delete any icon file once it is used by Windows.
	<p><a name="c9"><li><a href="#qc9"><b>Should I store important icons in a dedicated folder?</b></a><br>
		Although you can use icons directly from within the <b>ICL</b> libraries, I recommend
		that you extract and store in a standard folder any icon used within your system. I
		created a folder called <b>c:\icons</b> for this purpose. It is much easier to find and
		manage a smaller number of frequently used icons by having them all in one place.
		There is also less danger of you moving or deleting this folder.
	<p><a name="c10"><li><a href="#qc10"><b>What formats can I select to save the icon?</b></a><br>
		You can extract and save icon images as <b>ICO</b> icon files or as <b>BMP</b>
		bitmap files. If the original icon contains multiple images then the extracted icon
		file will also contain multiple images. If you save such an icon in the bitmap format
		then multiple bitmap files, one for each icon image, will be saved. At this time, it
		is not possible to save icons as <b>GIF</b> or <b>JPG</b> images, so you would have
		to use another graphics editing program to convert <b>BMP</b> files to these formats.
		A future version of Icon Library will probably have the ability to save files in these
		additional formats.
	<p><a name="c11"><li><a href="#qc11"><b>Why can't I save icons as GIF or JPG images?</b></a><br>
		I have not worked out how to do it yet. This new version of Icon Library has already
		been delayed too long and I did not want to hold up the release further by adding
		more and more options. The main purpose of this version is to release a library of
		20,000 icons which is double what was provided in the previous version. Once this
		version has been released, and a reasonable number of registrations indicate support
		for the product, I will develop a new version which allows you to save icons as
		<b>GIF</b> or <b>JPG</b> images.

	<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Customisation</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="d1"><li><a href="#qd1"><b>Can I customise the Icon Library menus?</b></a><br>
		Yes. Full instructions are provided <a href="manual_4.html#ini">here</a>.
	<p><a name="d2"><li><a href="#qd2"><b>What is the format of the ICOLIB.INI file?</b></a><br>
		The format of this file is described <a href="manual_4.html#ini">here</a>.
	<p><a name="d3"><li><a href="#qd3"><b>I tried to change the menu, but it did not work. Why?</b></a><br>
		A common mistake is to have non-sequential item numbers for the menu parameters. You
		should also make sure your icon pathnames are correct, and that you did not leave out
		the little comma after the pathname. I am planning to make future versions of Icon
		Library more robust in this area, but for now just be careful with the contents of
		the <b>INI</b> file.
	<p><a name="d4"><li><a href="#qd4"><b>How can I add my own icons to my personal collection?</b></a><br>
		Yes, you can. I suggest that you collect all your icons into one or more <b>ICL</b>
		library files using a program such as <a href="http://impactsoft.com">MicroAngleo</a>.
		You can then add the pathnames for these icon library files into your <b>icolib.ini</b>
		file. Your icons will appear as menu items in the Icon Library viewer program.
	<p><a name="d5"><li><a href="#qd5"><b>Can I contribute my own icons to your collection?</b></a><br>
		If you want to add your icon collection to Icon Library for public distribution, I am
		happy to receive your contribution. I am particularly interested in specialised
		collections of icons on various topics. I am even more interested if the icons have
		256 colors. Please <a href="mailto:steve@iconlibrary.com">email</a> me if you
		have something to contribute. Some simple conditions apply:
		<ul>
			<li>The icons must be yours to give. I don't want to get into any
			copyright battles with icon artists.
			<li>In return for good quality contributions, I will give you a copy of the
			registered version of Icon Library for free. I decide what constitutes a
			"good quality contribution".
			<li>You will not be entitled to any royalties or payments in return for your
			icons.
			<li>You will retain the copyright to your collection.
			<li>I can include a text file with Icon Library distributions giving full
			credit to icon contributers.
			<li>Normally, I would only distribute user contributions in the registered
			version of Icon Library, but if you insist on your icons being distributed
			for free, I can include them in the shareware version of Icon Library.
			<li>You have the option to remove your icons from Icon Library after a period
			of three (3) months has expired.
		</ul>
	<p><a name="d6"><li><a href="#qd6"><b>Can I edit icons or change icons in ICL files with Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		Icon Library is <b>not</b> an icon editing program. It is not able to edit icons or to
		change the contents of <b>ICL</b> icon library files. There are other well written
		programs such as <a href="http://impactsoft.com" target="ma">MicroAngelo</a> which
		perform these functions. Icon Library does not try to compete with these top quality
		products.

	<br><br><br><font size="+1"><b>Advanced Topics</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="e1"><li><a href="#qe1"><b>How do I change various desktop icons on my system?</b></a><br>
		Follow these links to find out how to change icons for your
		<a href="application_1.html#desktop">Drives</a>,
		<a href="application_1a.html#desktop">Folders</a>,
		<a href="application_1b.html#desktop">Files</a>,
		<a href="application_1c.html#desktop">Shortcuts</a> or
		<a href="application_1d.html#desktop">System</a>
	<p><a name="e2"><li><a href="#qe2"><b>Can I use icons with more than 16 colors on my desktop?</b></a><br>
		Windows can display icons with more than 16 colors, but you may have to 
		<a href="application_2.html#colors">change some properties</a> to make it work.
	<p><a name="e3"><li><a href="#qe3"><b>How can I create my own icons?</b></a><br>
		You can either create completely original icons or use 
		<a href="application_4.html#derive">existing</a> Icon Library icons on
		which to base your creations. Icon Library does not have capabilities to create or edit
		icons so you have to use another application designed for the purpose. A program that I use
		and highly recommend is called <a href="http://impactsoft.com" target="ma">MicroAngelo</a>.
		This program will let you create and edit icons, and then merge them into <b>ICL</b>
		library files.
	<p><a name="e4"><li><a href="#qe4"><b>Can I use icons as images on my web site?</b></a><br>
		Not directly. You first have to save the image contained within the icon as a bitmap file.
		Icon Library has the option to extract and save bitmap images from icons in the collection.
		There is an <a href="application_5.html#bmp">Application Note</a> available which explains
		in more detail how to use icons as bitmap images. Here is a simple example of an icon,
		which has been extracted into a bitmap file, being displayed on a web page<br>
		<center><img src="../images/sample_icon.bmp" alt="Sample Icon as BMP"></center>
		Some older versions of web browsers may not be able to display bitmap images. If this is a
		concern, then you may want to convert your bitmap images to either the GIF or JPG format
		using one of the many graphics manipulation packages that are
		<a href="iconprograms_1.html">available</a>.
	<p><a name="e5"><li><a href="#qe5"><b>What other programs are useful with Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		There are several programs which are useful companions to Icon Library. These programs will
		provide you with the ability to create and edit icons, collect icons into libraries,
		manage icons on your desktop using an easy GUI interface, convert images formats, and use
		icon images as the building blocks for larger, more complex images. Here is a brief
		description of <a href="iconprograms_1.html">a selection</a> of these useful tools.
	<p><a name="e6"><li><a href="#qe6"><b>Where can I obtain more icons to use with Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		Over time, new collections of icons, especially 256 color icons, will be added to
		<a href="http://iconlibrary.com">http://iconlibrary.com</a>.
	<p><a name="e7"><li><a href="#qe7"><b>Is it legal to use copyright icons with Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		It may be possible to use icon collections created by other authors with Icon Library. I
		don't see any legal problems as long as you do not redistribute those copyright icons.
	<p><a name="e8"><li><a href="#qe8"><b>Can Icon Library handle icons with 256 or more colors?</b></a><br>
		Yes. Icon Library will handle icons with 256 colors or more.
	<p><a name="e9"><li><a href="#qe9"><b>Can Icon Library handle icons other than 32x32 pixels?</b></a><br>
		Yes. Icon Library can handle icons of any size.
	<p><a name="e10"><li><a href="#qe10"><b>Can Icon Library handle ICO files containing multiple icons?</b></a><br>
		Yes. Icon Library can handle <b>ICO</b> files containing multiple icons of varying color
		depths or sizes, however, it will only display 32x32 pixel images with either 16 or 256
		colors. All images will be extracted correctly into an <b>ICO</b> file or multiple
		<b>BMP</b> files.
	<p><a name="e11"><li><a href="#qe11"><b>Can Icon Library handle icons in EXE and DLL files?</b></a><br>
		No yet. In the current version of Icon Library, there is a technical issue preventing icons
		from being extracted from <b>EXE</b> and <b>DLL</b> files. I hope to have this problem
		fixed in a future version of Icon Library.

	<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Registration</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="f1"><li><a href="#qf1"><b>Do I have to register?</b></a><br>
		Theoretically, you should register if you plan to use Icon Library for more than
		30 days, however, I realise that there is no way I can enforce this condition without
		including expiry dates with the program. This is something I have no plans to do.
		I therefore rely on your conscience. You should register if you decide the product is
		useful to you and you would like to reward me for the thousands of hours spent
		creating Icon Library. Of course, by registering, you will also reap substantial
		rewards. See the next answer.
	<p><a name="f2"><li><a href="#qf2"><b>What are the benefits to me if I register?</b></a><br>
		These are the benefits of registering:
		<ul>
			<li>You receive 20,000+ icons instead of 3,000
			<li>There are no more popup reminders when the program starts
			<li>You are entitled to email support
			<li>Your contribution helps further development of Icon Library
			<li>You are entitled to free upgrades to future full versions of Icon Library
			<li>You feel warm and fuzzy inside because you helped a shareware author
		</ul>
	<p><a name="f3"><li><a href="#qf3"><b>How do I register?</b></a><br>
		You can register by going to <a href="http://iconlibrary.com">http://iconlibrary.com</a>
		and clicking on either the <b>Digibuy</b> or <b>PayPal</b> links. You will be required
		to pay a US$29 registration fee if you are purchasing a single license. When I have
		been notified by <b>Digibuy</b> or <b>PayPal</b> that you have registered, I will
		email you instructions on how to download the full, registered version of Icon Library.

	<p><a name="f4"><li><a href="#qf4"><b>How much does it cost?</b></a><br>
		A single license costs US$29.
	<p><a name="f5"><li><a href="#qf5"><b>Do you have multiple or site licenses?</b></a><br>
		Yes. I provide substantial discounts for multiple licenses.
		<ul>
			<li>1       license.  No discount. (US$29.00)
			<li>2 - 5   licenses. 15% discount. (US$25.00 each copy)
			<li>6 - 20  licenses. 30% discount. (US$20.00 each copy)
			<li>21 +    licenses. 50% discount. (US$15.00 each copy)
		</ul>
		I can also provide site licenses for larger organisations by negotiation.
	<p><a name="f6"><li><a href="#qf6"><b>Can I register with a credit card?</b></a><br>
		Yes. Both <b>Digibuy</b> and <b>Paypal</b> have facilities for <b>secure</b> credit
		card payments. A link is provided on the
		<a href="http://iconlibrary.com">Icon Library website</a>.
	<p><a name="f7"><li><a href="#qf7"><b>Can I register using the online PayPal payment service?</b></a><br>
		Yes. A link is provided on the <a href="http://iconlibrary.com">Icon Library website</a>.
	<p><a name="f8"><li><a href="#qf8"><b>Can I register with a personal check?</b></a><br>
		Yes. I accept personal checks, bank checks or even cash. However, it may not be a
		good idea to send cash in the post. Currencies other than US Dollars are accepted
		as long as the amount paid is roughly equivalent to US$29. If you want to pay using
		a check, you will also have to print, then fill out a
		<a href="form.html" target="form">Registration Form</a>.
		Send the completed details with your payment to the address shown on the form. Download
		intructions for the full version of Icon Library will be emailed to you as soon as
		your registration is received. I can also email the program to you if you select this
		option. Make sure that your email INTRAY can accept large ZIP-file attachments. Many
		email providers have started to restrict incoming attachments as a form of virus
		protection. It is probably more reliable for you to download the program yourself rather
		than receiving it by email. Also, please note that it takes 1-2 weeks for postal mail
		to reach me in Australia. Online registration is quicker!

	<br><br><font size="+1"><b>Copyright</b></font><br><br>
	<p><a name="g1"><li><a href="#qg1"><b>What are the license conditions for Icon Library?</b></a><br>
		Detailed license conditions are available <a href="policy_1.html">here</a>.
	<p><a name="g2"><li><a href="#qg2"><b>Do I have to pay royalties for comercial use of the icons?</b></a><br>
		After registration, no further royalty payments for the use of small numbers of
		icons is required. Please remember that I do not allow a competing product to be
		created using icons from the Icon Library collection.
	<p><a name="g3"><li><a href="#qg3"><b>Who owns copyright to the icons?</b></a><br>
		I am not a lawyer so the following may be complete rubbish.
		<ul>
			<li>Most individual icons contained within Icon Library are public domain.
			<li>Some icons represent commercial trademarks or products and copyright is
			owned by their respective organisations.
			<li>Some public domain icons represent copyright images, for example, the
			Star Trek logo. Copyright is owned by their respective organisations.
			<li>Some icon collections may be owned by icon artists. Permission will be
			requested to use these icons and credit provided if authorship details are
			known.
			<li>The copyright for the categories and collections of icons and the viewer
			program is owned by Steve Balogh.
			<li>The copyright to all documentation, user manuals and web pages is owned
			by Steve Balogh. The copyright to some of the frames surrounding the web
			pages may be owned by Danworld Inc. (used with permission)
		</ul>
	<p><a name="g4"><li><a href="#qg4"><b>What value have you added to these public domain icons?</b></a><br>
		<ul>
			<li>Searching the net and other sources for public domain
			icons.
			<li>Finding and removing tens of thousands of duplicate icons
			from these combined collections, thus creating a unique
			collection of icons.
			<li>Classifying these unique icons into categories to make
			icons easier to find.
			<li>Removing fixed (often white) backgrounds in icons by
			making the backgrounds transparent where approriate.
			<li>Correcting any minor flaws in the icon artwork.
			<li>Creating variations on individual icons where there is
			a need (eg. to complete a set of arrows, different colors, etc).
			<li>Placing individual icons into ICL library files, thus
			saving the huge amounts of disk space normally taken by
			individual icons and greatly speeding up disk access to icons.
			<li>Providing documentation and application notes to help you
			use these icons in a meaningful way.
			<li>Maintain my icon viewing software.
