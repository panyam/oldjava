Please note that although the following programs have much more powerful icon editing and library
manipulation features than Icon Library, the main reason Icon Library exists is to provide a large
collection of sorted icons to the user. I have not tried to compete with these product's powerful
features. It is quite practical to use some of these products in conjunction with the Icon Library
collection.
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.impactsoftware.com/" target="prog">Microangelo</a> from ImpactSoft
	contains several utilities including an icon editor and icon library manager.
	<b>Microangelo Studio</b> is a graphics editor that can manipulate images in all sizes and color
	formats. A full-featured tool set includes a graphic selection tool, pencil, multiple brush
	sizes, color erasers, flood, rectangle, and ellipse drawing tools. Intelligent paint modifiers
	can apply color gradients, dodge and burn existing colors, and anti-alias drawing operations
	against the graphics below. Complete clipboard support to cut, copy, and even scale paste
	operations. Studio can import and scale bitmap images with awesome results. An actual size
	viewing area offers a "real time" display of the edit session as you work. Perhaps one of the
	best features of all, a powerful undo/redo manager allows you to step through many changes of
	thousands of pixels, encouraging creative experimentation.<br>
	<img src="../images/microangelo_1.gif" border=1 alt="MicroAngelo Icon Editor">
	<b>Microangelo Librarian</b> is a powerful utility for viewing and managing icon libraries of all
	types. Use it to seek out all icon sizes and color formats. Librarian displays full-window
	viewing of every icon image in any standard icon file type. Drag 'n' drop icons between
	Librarian windows or double-click any icon to instantly edit it using Microangelo's Studio
	component. Easily extract embedded icons to <b>ICO</b> files - just drag and drop them into any
	Windows folder.<br>

	<li><a href="http://www.cursorarts.com/" target="prog">IconForge</a> from Cursorarts
	can create or change icons, cursors, animated cursors and icon libraries for Windows. It is
	optimized for editing small images, you will find a full set of painting tools at your
	disposal. You can import from and export to a variety of other image, icon and animation
	types, so you can take advantage of work which you've already created or scanned from other
	sources. IconForge is also an excellent tool for other graphics, such as producing
	bookmark/favorites icons for a web site, repeating tiles for wallpaper backgrounds, animated
	GIF bullets to make listings stand out, or cursors for various projects.<br>
	<img src="../images/icon_forge_1.gif" border=1 alt="IconForge Icon Editor">
	IconForge also has built-in library functions allowing you to assemble and edit collections
	of icons in Icon <b>ICO</b> and Cursor Library <b>CUL</b> formats. Library files make it easy
	to organize your icon images, save disk space, and include with programming projects. You can
	even create your own <b>EXE</b> programs for your icon and cursor libraries, complete with
	Setup and Viewer utilities, which you can distribute or sell to others.<br>

	<br><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.aha-soft.com/articons/scr.htm" target="prog">ArtIcons</a> from Aha-Soft
	is an advanced icon-specific utility for Windows. It allows professional and amateur graphic artists

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/" target="prog">PhotoShop</a> from Adobe
	is the professional image-editing standard helping you produce the highest quality images for print,
	the Web, and anywhere else. It is the best choice for editing extracted icons that have been saved
	as <b>BMP</b> images. Photoshop has far too many features and abilities to be described here. Visit
	the website for more information. There are also thousands of web sites providing hints and add-on
	filters for Photoshop. Use the keyword <b>Photoshop</b> in
	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Photoshop" target="prog">Yahoo.com</a> or
	<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Photoshop" target="prog">Google.com</a>

	<br><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.jasc.com/" target="prog">Paintshop Pro</a> from Jasc Software is an
	excellent second choice after Photoshop as an image editor. Paintshop Pro has two main advantages
	over Photoshop. It is much cheaper and it is quicker to learn because it does not have such a vast
	array of features, many of which are not very useful for creating simple images based on icons. On
	the other hand, Paintshop Pro does have a good selection of painting, drawing, text and image editing
	tools, and like Photoshop, it uses image layers which is a particularly useful feature when merging
	multiple icons, saved as <b>BMP</b> format images, into a single picture. Paintshop Pro also has
	a huge web following and there are many sites dedicated to this program. Once again, using the
	keyword <b>Paintshop</b>, try searching in
	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=Paintshop" target="prog">Yahoo.com</a> or
	<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=Paintshop" target="prog">Google.com</a>
	for many relavent sites.<br>
	<img src="../images/paintshop_1.gif" border=1 alt="Paintshop Pro Sample">
	<br><br>
	<li><a href="http://www.lview.com" target="prog">LView Pro</a> created by Leonardo Loureiro is a
	full-featured Image Processor that eliminates the need to purchase and learn how to use many separate
	single-purpose applications. Some of the editors included in LView Pro are an image editor, image file
	browser, slide show viewer, contact sheet builder and web gallery builder. In conjunction with Icon
	Library, Lview is particularly useful as a screen capture device, for cropping and resizing images,
	adjusting brightness, contrast and color, and converting from <b>BMP</b> to many other image
	formats. Using the keyword <b>LView</b>, try searching in
	<a href="http://search.yahoo.com/bin/search?p=%22LView+Pro%22" target="prog">Yahoo.com</a> or
	<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&q=LView" target="prog">Google.com</a>
	for many sites dedicated to LView Pro.<br>

<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.imaginary.co.za" target="prog">More Properties</a> by Imaginary Software has
	the ability to change a huge number of parameters on your system, including several icon related ones.
	<ul>
		<li>It can specify whether to display small or large desktop icons. If you choose large icons,
		Windows will try to use 48x48 icons if they are available, otherwise it creates fairly ugly
		magnifications of the standard 32x32 icons.
		<li>It can change the horizontal and vertical spacing of icons.
		<li>Most importantly, it has the ability to change dozens of standard icon images on the desktop.

	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/ntworkstation/downloads/PowerToys/Networking/NTTweakUI.asp"
	target="prog">TweakUI</a> is a utility by Microsoft that allows you to adjust many aspects of your
	Windows User Interface including a few options related to icons. It can specify which icons are
	visible on the desktop, and whether the shortcut arrow is visible. It also the ability to "repair" your
	Windows Explorer icons by rebuilding all Explorer icons and removing any unused ones from memory. This
	is useful if you find that Explorer is displaying the wrong icon for a program or shortcut. This program
	does not have as many icon related options as More Properties mentioned previously, but it does have its
	uses, especially for non-icon related tweaking.<br>

I have not tried to mention every icon manipulation and graphic editing program available today.
There are just too many! If you are not happy with my selections, I suggest that you perform a
search of the Internet where you will find many more similar programs. If you find some that
stand out from the rest particularly well, feel free to send email to
<a href="mailto:steve@iconlibrary.com">steve@iconlibrary.com</a> mentioning what you found and
why I should include it in this list. Please note that this <b>is not an invitation for every
other program author to request free advertising</b> in this section. Most likely I will ignore
all such requests. But if something really stands out, please let me know. Thanks.
