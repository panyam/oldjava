I am not a lawyer, so I will try to keep things simple!<br>
<ol>
	<li><b>Icon Library ZIP or EXE distribution file</b><br>
	This is the ZIP archive by which Icon Library is distributed. It may
	take the form of a ZIP archive or an EXE self-extracting
	archive. The copyright to this file is owned by Steve Balogh. You
	are not allowed to redistribute altered versions of these archives in
	any way. You are not allowed to redistribute the registered version of
	the Icon Library ZIP or EXE archive files at all without
	my written permission. You
	are allowed to redistribute the shareware version of this archive
	on any media unless I have specifically requested you not to do so.
	<li><b>Icon Library Viewer Program</b><br>
	This is the program you see when you click on the <b>icolib.exe</b>
	file. The copyright to this program is owned by Steve Balogh. The
	registered version of <b>icolib.exe</b> may not be redistributed on
	any media under any circumstances without my written permission.
	The shareware version of the program may be redistributed as long
	as it is contained within the <b>original icolib zip file</b>. It may
	not be redistributed seperately or as part of other software products.
	<li><b>Icon Collection</b><br>
	The overall collection of icons and the categories into which they
	have been organised is the copyright of Steve Balogh. The icons may
	not be redistributed in this form on any media under any
	circumstances without my written permission. The shareware version
	of the icons may be redistributed as long as they are contained within
	the <b>original icolib zip file</b>. You are not permitted to use any
	of these icon collections to create a software product which competes
	with Icon Library. For example, if you develop your own icon viewing
	program, you are not permitted to use my collection of icons as the
	data source for your viewer.
	<li><b>Small Subsets of Icon Collection</b>
	Individual icons are mostly in the public domain and so the copyright
	to them is not owned by Steve Balogh. You are allowed to redistribute
	individual icons or small numbers of icons in any way. You are also
	allowed to modify individual icons.
	<li><b>Trademark Icons</b><br>
	Some icons represent corporate trademarks or products. These should
	be used with care by Icon Library users. For example, using a
	Microsoft Excel icon to represent the Excel spreadsheet product in
	your desktop application would probably be acceptable. Using the same
	icon to represent your own software product would not be acceptable,
	especially if you distribute your product to the public. Here are the
	<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/permission/copyrgt/cop-img.htm#Icons" target="ms">Microsoft</a>
	license conditions for use of their icons. Note that they do allow use
	of their icons when used with their products.
	<li><b>Documentation</b><br>
	The copyright to all documentation distributed with Icon Library or
	the Icon Library web site located at
	<a href="http://iconlibrary.com">iconlibrary.com</a> is owned by
	Steve Balogh. The copyright to the heading, left column and footer
	portions of the iconlibrary.com web site are owned by Danworld Inc.
	<li><b>Fees and Royalties</b><br>
	Only a flat fee is required for Icon Library, the amount depends
	on how many workstations Icon Library itself being used on. If you
	have many developers and they all require a copy, then multiple
	(discounted) licenses are required. However, in most cases you may
	only need Icon Library to be on one developers PC since you would
	not be using Icon Library on a day-to-day basis during product
	development. I do not require any further royalties or additional
	fees for the use of individual icons used in your products. You are
	not allowed to distribute the registered version of Icon Library
	with your products.
	<li><b>If the icons are public domain, what are you paying for?</b><br>
	I do not claim to have created any of the icons, although there are
	about 150 of my own in the collection. My contribution, and what I
	am asking payment for, are the thousands of hours spent in creating
	this value-added, extensive library of icons. My work includes...
	<ul>
		<li>Searching the net and other sources for public domain
		icons.
		<li>Finding and removing tens of thousands of duplicate icons
		from these combined collections, thus creating a unique
		collection of icons.
		<li>Classifying these unique icons into categories to make
		icons easier to find.
		<li>Removing fixed (often white) backgrounds in icons by
		making the backgrounds transparent where approriate.
		<li>Correcting any minor flaws in the icon artwork.
		<li>Creating variations on individual icons where there is
		a need (eg. to complete a set of arrows, different colors, etc).
		<li>Placing individual icons into ICL library files, thus
		saving the huge amounts of disk space normally taken by
		individual icons and greatly speeding up disk access to icons.
		<li>Providing documentation and application notes to help you
		use these icons in a meaningful way.
		<li>Maintain my icon viewing software.
	</ul>
	By registering a copy of Icon Library, you give me the incentive to
	continue spending many hours working on this product.
