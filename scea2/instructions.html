Certified Enterprise Architect for J2EE Exam, the multiple choice
test, tested your knowledge in the areas of general architecture and
J2EE.&nbsp; Part 2 of the exam will test whether you can apply that
knowledge to a business problem and come up with the architecture and
design of a system using J2EE. You will be required to read through
requirements and business models, and then architect and design a
system to support the requirements. Remember the most important
requirement of all: it must be J2EE.<!-- Table of Contents --></FONT></FONT>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">FlyByNight, Inc.
(FBN) has been in business for 10 years as a regional commuter
airline. FBN does not follow industry standards and uses their own
travel agents to book all airfares. The FBN travel agents use a
legacy system written in Cobol that accesses an IMS database through
3270 screens. FBN uses TransMaster to process the credit cards for
flight purchases. FBN communicates with TransMaster via a secured
socket across a dedicated line. TransMaster, in order to expand
market share, is in the process of creating a new API that relies on
the Internet. See the attached <A HREF="./TransMaster API Specification.html">TransMaster
API Specification</A>.</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">FBN also has a
frequent flyer mileage system that tracks mileage earned and used. To
this point in FBN&rsquo;s existence, it is the only system that has a
web interface. FBN travel agents with their 3270 terminal do not have
access to this system. So, when customers decide to book awards
travel the agent must place the customer on hold and go to a shared
computer to retrieve the customers mileage account status. FBN does
not wish to re-write this system at this time, but would like to have
the content available to the customer using the web and the travel
agent using an application. This system was developed using Perl,
HTML, CGI and an Oracle database.</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier">Recently, FBN
decided to expand operations to fly nationally. In addition to FBN
travel agents, they want to make it easier for consumers to book
travel, so they would like a web site for booking airfare. FBN would
like to make the user interface more appealing for their travel
agents by replacing the 3270 terminal with one that can support a
graphical user interface. FBN currently books 20,000 airfares per day
and they are expecting that to increase 10 fold within the first
month of going national. FBN will be spending $10 million on a
national advertising campaign to coincide with the launching of their
web site.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;

<H3><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><FONT SIZE=3>Interview with the
CEO and CIO of FBN:</FONT></FONT></H3>
<P><BR><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
Can you tell us about current and future aircraft?</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CEO:</B> We
currently have 10 Boeing 737s and ordered three new 757s. We hope to
supplement our fleet with two large 767s in the near future to cover
our most popular routes. Oh, and of course our four turbojets.</FONT></FONT>
<BR>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
One of the more complicated issues for airlines is their pricing
model. How do you price your seats?</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CEO:</B>
Complicated is right. FBN prides itself on a simple pricing scheme.
Our market research has shown that the simple pricing is one of our
biggest selling points. The simple pricing scheme consists of one
price for first class and one price for coach.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
Is this regardless of destination and advance purchase?</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CEO:</B> No,
the flat price is per destination, but it does not matter when you
purchase the ticket. So the person who purchases the ticket two weeks
before the flight will pay the same as the person who walks up right
before the flight takes off.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
How many concurrent users are you expecting in peak time?</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CIO:</B> Our
current system has 35 concurrent Travel Agents and we are projecting
to have 20 Travel Agents and 200 web users concurrently using the
system initially. These numbers are expected to increase monthly over
the next couple of months to reach what we feel will be our maximum
of 20 Travel Agents and 600 web users. We really need to ensure that
the Travel Agents have the fastest system possible in order to meet
the customer expectations, therefore we have a hard requirement that
response time never exceed 5 seconds. We have assumed that most web
users will still be using 28.8 modems, so response time cannot exceed
10 seconds more than 20% of the time.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
What type of hardware will be used for deployment?</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CIO:</B> We
have chosen an E10000 from Sun Microsystems as the machine for the
application server, an E6500 to host the Oracle database and two
450's for the web servers. All of these machines are in addition to
the E5500 running the Frequent Flyer system.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp;
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
Speaking of the Frequent Flyer system, why are you not replacing it
with this rewrite?</FONT></FONT> 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CEO:</B> Let
me handle this. We spent a half million dollars 6 months ago to get
this system in place. I for one am not ready to throw it away and
spend another half million to replace it. You will have to interface
with what is there and if this project goes smoothly and the J2EE
application servers prove to work, then we can talk about rewriting
it.&nbsp; Our travel agents Java application must be able to access
the system and we want our customers to have access through the
Internet.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
Why do you use TransMaster and is it possible to replace?</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CIO:</B>
First, no it is not possible to replace. TransMaster was one of only
two credit card processing companies that still supported the COBOL
interface we needed. They are in the process of re-inventing
themselves and creating a web presence so they can continue to thrive
and open new markets. Since they have been there for us on the
mainframe, we feel like to own it to them to use their new flagship
product. You will need to do whatever is necessary to support their
product.</FONT></FONT> <BR>&nbsp; 
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>Interviewer:</B>
Do you have service level agreements in place with TransMaster?</FONT></FONT>
</P>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT FACE="Courier New, Courier"><B>FBN CIO:</B>
Yes. They have committed to have their site available four 9's. Also,
they have committed to a response time of no more than 3 seconds
during peak time.</FONT></FONT>
