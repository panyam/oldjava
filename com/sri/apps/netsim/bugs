List of Known Bugs:

1)  Cannot handle Loops, as no Spanning Tree or Routing Protocols are
    implemented.

2)  With Static routes, multiple matches arent taken into account.
    For example if 10.0.0.0/8 is off one Firewall/Router, but one of the
    hosts in this subnet hangs of a different path, the packet would be
    dropped as the path would be unknown, even if there is a
    defaultInterface set.

3)  Firewall Rules.
