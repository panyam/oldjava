Things To Do: <br>
1) A Lot
<br>
2) Fixed Point calculations <br>
3) Make it as a proper engine which would accept, VRML syntax <br>
<br> <br>
Tips: Always use wire frame rendering to "adjust" the models' location and
sizes.  Once you are sure of its location, orientation and size, use the
other shading types.
